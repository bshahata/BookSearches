# Google Book Search


This project is a search engine for books that uses the Google Books API. It was originally built with a RESTful API, but has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The application is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The MongoDB database stores information about the books that users save to the backend. The Node.js/Express.js server and API handle the backend logic and communication with the database. The React front end provides the user interface for searching for books and interacting with the saved books feature.
